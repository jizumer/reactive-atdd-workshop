# Contributions Guidelines

## Where to start

Read the documentation available at the README in order to get used to the project. Communicate with the team in case of doubts. Update the README if your contribution affects the current documentation.

## Code of Conduct

Please try to follow the Kant’s categorical imperative “act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law_” (Immanuel Kant, 1785). Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals). When contributing behave the way described in the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/), specified in the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing to the repository

### Code Conventions

Follow widely accepted code conventions, including naming, organization, indentation and white spaces, comments, programming practices, etc.

It is recommended to use lint/linter tools to flag programming bugs and stylistic errors.

### Commits

Follow the conventions for commit messages, inspired by [these](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

- Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.

EXTRA

- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

Use an atomic approach when commiting in the repository, commit each fix or task as a separate change, thus making easy to roll back. Remember to commit and integrate early and often to ease the integration process.

### Pull request

Features and bug fixes must be linked to an issue, so the first step before contributing is the **creation of an issue**. The issue can be merged back by using **Pull Requests** to master branch. The administrator and the code reviewers will discuss with the developer through the Pull Request dialog.

### Language

Please use English everywhere: comments, documentation, issues, commits and pull requests.

## License

**IMPORTANT!** List all the third party licenses in the file THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES in order to avoid restrictions from them and readjust your implementation. We found good documentation about licenses [here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Code+Contribution+Guidelines).
